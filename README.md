## What Is This?

Haven is a **private chat server** you run on your own computer. Think Discord, but:

- **You own everything** — messages, data, the server itself
- **Nothing leaves your machine** — no cloud, no telemetry, no analytics
- **No account with anyone** — no email, no phone number, no verification
- **Free forever** — no subscriptions, no Nitro, no ads

You launch it, your friends connect to your IP address, and you have a private group chat with voice, images, themes, and games. That's it.

## Quick Start (Windows)

### 1. Install Node.js

Download and install from **[nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)** (LTS version). Restart your PC after installing.

### 2. Download Haven

Download this repository and unzip it anywhere. Desktop is fine.

### 3. Launch

Double-click **`Start Haven.bat`**

A terminal window opens. When you see `HAVEN is running`, it's ready.

### 4. Open the App

Your browser should open automatically. If not, go to:
```
https://localhost:3000
```

> You'll see a certificate warning — that's normal. Click **Advanced** → **Proceed**. Haven uses a self-signed certificate for encryption.

### 5. Create Your Admin Account

1. Click **Register**
2. Use the username `admin` (or whatever you set in your data directory's `.env`)
3. Pick a password
4. You're now the admin — you can create channels

### 6. Create a Channel & Invite Friends

1. Type a channel name in the sidebar and click **Create**
2. A channel code appears (8 characters like `a3f8b2c1`)
3. Send this code + your IP address to your friends
4. They go to `https://YOUR_IP:3000`, register, and enter the code

---

## Quick Start (Linux / macOS)

```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

The script handles everything: checks Node.js, installs dependencies, generates SSL certs, and launches.

Or manually:
```bash
npm install
node server.js
```

---

## Letting Friends Connect Over the Internet

If your friends aren't on your WiFi, you need to open a port on your router.

### Step 1 — Find Your Public IP

Go to [whatismyip.com](https://whatismyip.com). That's the address your friends will use.

### Step 2 — Port Forward

1. Log into your router (usually `http://192.168.1.1` or `http://10.0.0.1`)
2. Find **Port Forwarding** (sometimes called NAT or Virtual Servers)
3. Forward port **3000** (TCP) to your PC's local IP
4. Save

> **Find your local IP:** Open Command Prompt → type `ipconfig` → look for IPv4 Address (e.g. `192.168.1.50`)

### Step 3 — Windows Firewall

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Haven Chat" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 3000 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow
```

### Step 4 — Share With Friends

Send them:
```
https://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:3000
```

Tell them to click **Advanced** → **Proceed** on the certificate warning. It's normal.

## Voice Chat

1. Join a text channel
2. Click **🎤 Join Voice**
3. Allow microphone access
4. Adjust anyone's volume with their slider
5. Click **📞 Leave** when done

Voice is peer-to-peer — audio goes directly between users, not through the server. Requires HTTPS.

---

## Admin Guide

If you registered with the admin username, you can:

- **Create / delete channels**
- **Kick users** — disconnects them (they can rejoin)
- **Mute users** — timed mute (can't send messages)
- **Ban users** — permanent ban (can't connect)
- **Delete users** — remove banned accounts (frees up their username)
- **Auto-cleanup** — configure automatic deletion of old messages (Settings → Admin)
- **Server settings** — EULA, max message age, DB size limits

Access admin controls in the **Settings** panel (⚙️ gear icon in the sidebar).

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "Node.js is not installed" | Install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Restart PC. |
| Browser shows blank page | Clear cache or try incognito/private window |
| Friends can't connect | Check port forwarding + firewall. Make sure server is running. |
| "Error: EADDRINUSE" | Another app is using port 3000. Change `PORT` in `.env`. |
| Voice chat echoes | Use headphones |
| Voice doesn't work remotely | Must use `https://`, not `http://` |
| Certificate error in browser | Normal — click Advanced → Proceed |

## Backing Up Your Data

All your data lives in a dedicated directory **outside** the Haven code folder:

| OS | Location |
|----|----------|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Haven\` |
| Linux / macOS | `~/.haven/` |

Inside you'll find:
- **`haven.db`** — all messages, users, and channels
- **`.env`** — your configuration
- **`certs/`** — SSL certificates
- **`uploads/`** — uploaded images

Copy the entire folder somewhere safe to back up everything. The Haven code directory contains no personal data.
